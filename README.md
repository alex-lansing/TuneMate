In this project, I plan to analyze the user experience of the music learning websites LiteNote (https://www.lightnote.co/) and Learning Music (https://learningmusic.ableton.com/). LiteNote invites users to learn music theory through interactive activities and educative visualizations. Topics include Sound Waves, Harmony, Scales, Chords, Keys, and Diatonic Chords. I am interesting in analyzing this site because I have studied music theory myself, and I feel this site provides a user experience that is effective for those hoping to study music theory. The Learning Music site teaches users how to make music digitally. The website presents sequential lessons on beats, tempo, bars, and making your own covers of songs. I plan to further analyze the 10 Usability Heurisics of each site, including user control and freedom, recognition quality, and user help availability. I hope to find what adds to the usability of these sites, and further, what improvements could be made to create a better user experience.
