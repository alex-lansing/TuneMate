# TuneMate
### Alexandra Lansing, 2022
Mobile apps and websites have become increasingly popular platforms for education. With numerous digital resources, learning a new skill seems as easy as the click of a button. For musicians, YouTube provides instrument tutorials, Abelton.com offers digital music lessons, Musicate provides lessons on mobile devices… countless platforms present learning material for musicians.

But despite the many resources, there is still a limited amount of mobile applications that support music learners’ needs. Based on my user research, music learners desire a platform that is simple, straightforward, and personalized to experience level. Further, they need a community. My qualitative research has shown that one of the most valued aspects of music is the ability to learn and create with other people. Musicians require insight, support, and collaboration -- yet many struggle to find partners.

These findings thus inspired TuneMate: a mobile application that would provide personalized music lessons and a platform to connect local musicians. This mobile app project is a fun exploration consisting of user research, iterative design, and prototyping.
