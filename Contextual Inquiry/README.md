# Qualitative User Research (Contextual Inquiry)
## Assignment 3: Learning from People in Context
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Research Goal and Requirements

### Main Activity and Goals
This research portion of my project is aimed to investigate how users interact with music-making products to learn music. In this study, I hope to further understand how a pianist learns music through digital applications and the piano instrument. This study will provide insight for improvements needed in the design of online music-learning platforms.

### Basic Need Involved for Activity
The basic needs involved for this activity are esteem and cognitive needs. In regards to esteem, user needs a supported sense of self. This involves the feelings of competence, confidence, and freedom when interacting with the activity. In regards to cognitive needs, the user needs an encouragement for creativity, foresight, curiosity, and meaning. The user should be motivated to execute specified activities through creative and free exploration.

### Traditional/Current Solution(s) to Satisfy Needs
The current way to satisfy the need for esteem is providing users multiple ways to learn music. Many online platforms present different options for numerous learning methods. This includes diverse interactive activities, plenty of help/information options, and lesson plans made for musicians of different experience levels. These various options benefit user self-esteem by increasing their confidence and competence in activities, regardless of skill level. YouTube is one example that presents effective solutions to this need. It is an easily accessible online platform that presents numerous music lessons (of all different levels) on music theory, chord progressions, and specific songs.

The current way to satisfy the cognitive need is providing users with the freedom to be creative and explore music topics. Many online music learning platforms allow users to explore different combinations of sounds, beats, and musical instruments. Other platforms also challenge users to learn new instruments or music techniques. This helps boost users' need for creativity, curiosity, and search for meaning. The Learning Music website is one example that presents effective solutions to this need. It invites users to create their own combinations of musical sounds, and challenges users to learn more about the creation of digital music.

### Limitations
The current limitation of music learning platforms is the ability for musicians to play together. Learning to create music with other people becomes an issue when other musicians are not located nearby. There are many applications that allow people to connect virtually including FaceTime, Google Duo, and Zoom. But it is difficult for video-call platforms to replicate the true experience of musicians playing in a space all together. Music learning platforms could improve in this area by connecting nearby musicians, or by creating software that helps users practice with other instrumental accompaniment.

## Target User

### User Characteristics
- Demographics: middle-aged male, interest in learning music
- Preferences: some experience with music instrument(s), digital music technology, and/or music theory
- Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise for this study

### Context of User's Activity
- Online via digital music-learning platforms/software
- At home, school, or other institution where users can learn instrumental music-making
- Under the condition that users do not have access to instruments, they may prefer to learn music online through free and accessible websites. Users may want to learn music online if they are interested in digital music-making. They might also want to explore online information before purchasing an instrument. Under the condition that users do have access to instruments, they may prefer to learn music on their instrument through in-person lessons, or through online tutorials such as YouTube videos or informational websites. Users may want to learn music at home or school with an instrument because these places provide a more private space to practice, and also provide a learning environment if the user chooses to take in-person lessons.
- It is important to note that users may want to learn music *both* online and in-person, because there are several digital music-learning applications that also provide help for instrumetal musicians.

### User's Execution of Activity
- Through online platforms, users can learn music by completing interactive tasks. Interactive tasks would have users create combinations of music components to produce an overall song. These music learning applications often present a lesson plan that includes a wide range of topics. For digital music-making, these topics may include beat combinations, sound creation, rhythm, and chord progressions. For music theory, the topics might cover scales, chords, time signatures, and tempo. 
- Through instruments, users can learn music through in-person tasks. This involves learning notes and how to play the instrument. Users can learn these tasks through an in-person teacher or through online tutorials. Learning to play the instrument involves learning the motor skills needed, reading notes on sheet music, and understanding rhythms and time signatures.

- The user that participated in this current study utilized a keyboard (Casio PX560 88 Key Digital Stage Piano), the music learning app "I-Real-Pro", and YouTube to complete the activities in this study.

## Methodology
- The observation method utilized in this study will be participatory observation. As the researcher, I will observe the typical activities of the participant while they execute their music learning activities. The user will understand they are participating in a study, but the interview will be more discussion-based, rather than being fully led by the researcher.
- The study will be conducted in the user's music practice space. This is a quiet apartment room with a piano, located in Westwood, Los Angeles, CA.
- There will be four main activities observed regarding the user's interactions with both an instrument and digital tools for music learning. Details are noted below in the Interview Overview section.
- The method of interaction in this study will involve participatory and overt interaction, where the user will demonstrate how they learn music in their own way, and will be aware that I am conducting a research study. I will sit adjacent to the user and observe as they complete the study.
- Data will be collected by video recoding via Zoom. I will also take brief notes on observations throughout the session in my mobile Notes app. An audio transcript will be downloaded after the session for post-study reference. Mobile app use will also be recorded if user decides to use phone applications.

### Interview Overview
1. Introduction: Provide user with information about the study and brief details about what they will be doing
2. Background: Questions about user and user's experience with music and music learning. Further questions about tools and techniques used by user during music learning.
3. Activities: Four open-ended activities for user to demonstrate different ways they learn music
    - Demonstrate use of mobile applications to help with learning music
    - Demonstrate use of online websites to help with learning music
    - Demonstrate learning music without online programs
    - Demonstrate learning how to make music with other musicians or other instrumental accompaniment
5. Post-Activity Questions: Problems experienced with music learning, more details about music learning methods. Questions ask user about issues they have experienced with music learning and methods they have used to better their experience.
6. Wrap-Up: Further open-ended questions about user's ideas for better music learning products.
7. Closing: Thank the user for participating in the study.

## Observations and Reflection
Below are noteable responses that may provide valuable insight for future research or design strategies:
| Video Time Mark, Topic| User Commentary | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 10:53, I-Real-Pro App | "It just eliminates me having to bring large stacks of music sheets to do a gig or something I'm gonna play at. So I just bring my phone and I know I can have every song I ever need." | Beneficial for users to have condensed, portable music information. Reducing the amount of books/paper/tools needed for music learning and music playing is desirable. |
| 13:39, I-Real-Pro App| "If I could add something to it, it doesn't tell me the melody or if there's an actual expected baseline or pattern behind the melody. It just has the chords." | User is searching for further information when using the music learning app. It appears that the mobile app only provides a limited amount of information about chords, and does not provide an option for further information or help with songs. User a broad set of options, information, and freedom when using music learning applications. |
| 18:45, Personal Learning Techniques | "I do a lot of just drills and exercises... If there was a way to virtually make that easier, that would be really great because it's not very fun, but something you need to do. | Basic mobility techniques when using instruments is commonly practiced without digital products. Users might seek for digital tools, apps, or websites that may help strengthen these techniques. Including an activity in an application that helps music learners pracice basic techniques appears desirable by current user.|
| 26:10, Learning to Play Music with Others | "It's hard to get a good group of people together. So one thing that I supplement with, that I think is very helpful, is YouTube." | It seems difficult for users to learn how to play music with other people. Providing instrumental accompanyment appears to be an effective solution to this issue. Music learning applications could potentially include instrumental accompanyments or social media to help users practice music along with other people. |
| 31:30, Playing Music with Others | "My favorite is to play with other people. Music is collaborative, it's a group thing... But it's not always available." | User desires to play with other people. He finds music a collaborative activity, but playing with others is not always an option. There is a need for applications that connect musicians so they have an opportunity to practice with one another. |
| 37:39, Repetitive Activity | "You can never be too rhythmically accurate. So I like to play with a metronome." | User finds metronome useful when playing instrument, and repeatedly uses metronome. Including a metronome in a music learning application to help users with rhythm and timing may be a potential improvement on music learning platforms. |

As the researcher, I thoroughly enjoyed the discussion-like style of the study. It was interesting to observe how a musician learns music through both instruments and digital applications. One interesting thing I noticed was that the I-Real-Pro application did not teach the musician the technical skills needed in piano playing. It appeared that it assisted in music learning by providing only the names of certain chords. Thus, a user of the I-Real-Pro application would need a higher level of experience with an instrument in order to use it. As for the YouTube application, it seemed there were more in-depth demonstrations of piano playing. Between these two applications that the user interacted with, I feel that YouTube would provide better music learning assistance for novice musicians. The current user seemed to have a high level of music experience, so these applications seemed effective in his music learning process. If I were to conduct this study again, I would analyze how musicians of less experience learn music. It is important for an application to provide lessons for users of all levels to ensure broad accessibility and usability.

To further reflect on my experience, I feel that keeping the user on track with each activity went smoothly. At first, this seemed difficult because I would love to watch the user play piano for hours on end. But the user followed instructions very well and I believe we wrapped up our session in a timely manner. If I were to run a Contextual Inquiry study again, I would send out a survey before the study with more in-depth questions. This would allow for a more productive session when I meet with the user.
