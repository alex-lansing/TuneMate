## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows creators and designers to consider the perspectives of different users. Storytelling highlights the context behind why and how a user interacts with a product. This is important for designing an interface and for usability testing because it can bring forward potential issues of a product, and inspires improvements that appeal to a broader span of users.

According to [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/scenarios.html), the top things to consider when writing scenarios are:
1. Who is the User? : Focus on the main user group interacting with the product
2. Why does the user interact with the product? : Consider what draws users to the product and their expectations of the product
3. What goals does the user have? : Understand what the user wants in a product and how you can integrate these wants/needs in the overall design
4. How can the user achieve their goals on the site? : Identify what will satisfy users and what will frustrate users in a product to eliminate potential barriers in the design

## Design Solution Tasks
Based on my previous research, there are 2 main tasks that demonstrate the envisioned functionality I am considering for my design solution. I plan to implement respective design features that will help improve the user's experience in these music learning tasks.

| Task | Purpose | Design Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Identify where to begin in a music lesson | Accomidate music learners of all experience levels, so they can begin lessons according to their own level of expertise. | **Quiz Feature**: Present a quiz at the beginning of the application that will gage what users know and what they have left to learn. At the end of the quiz, suggest which lesson users should start on. | 
| Find and connect with other local musicians/music learners | Allow users to learn how to make music alongside other musicians. Instrumental accompanyment is a vital part of music learning if users desire to play with other people. | **Social Connection**: Invite users to create a profile and post online to connect with other musicians. Provide joinable group chats for specific cities to ensure users can find other musicians that are nearby. |
