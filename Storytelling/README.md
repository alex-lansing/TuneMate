# UX Storytelling
## Assignment 4: Personas and Scenarios
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows creators and designers to consider the perspectives of different users. Storytelling highlights the context behind why and how a user interacts with a product. This is important for designing an interface and for usability testing because it can bring forward potential issues of a product, and inspires improvements that appeal to a broader span of users.

According to [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/scenarios.html), the top things to consider when writing scenarios are:
1. Who is the User? : Focus on the main user group interacting with the product
2. Why does the user interact with the product? : Consider what draws users to the product and their expectations of the product
3. What goals does the user have? : Understand what the user wants in a product and how you can integrate these wants/needs in the overall design
4. How can the user achieve their goals on the site? : Identify what will satisfy users and what will frustrate users in a product to eliminate potential barriers in the design

## Design Solution Tasks
Based on my previous research, there are 2 main tasks that demonstrate the envisioned functionality I am considering for my design solution. I plan to implement respective design features that will help improve the user's experience in these music learning tasks.

| Task | Purpose | Design Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Identify where to begin in a music lesson | Accomidate music learners of all experience levels, so they can begin lessons according to their own level of expertise. | **Placement Quiz**: Present a quiz at the beginning of the application that will gage what users know and what they have left to learn. At the end of the quiz, suggest which lesson users should start on. | 
| Find and connect with other local musicians/music learners | Allow users to learn how to make music alongside other musicians. Instrumental accompanyment is a vital part of music learning if users desire to play with other people. | **Social Connection**: Invite users to create a profile and post online to connect with other musicians. Provide joinable group chats for specific cities and a map visual to ensure users can find other musicians that are nearby. |

## User Scenarios & Journey Maps

### Dan's Scenario

#### Context
As a father with a full-time job, Dan has limited free time. However, he also has a passion for learning. In all the spare time he has, Dan enjoys picking up new hobbies to do himself or with his family. Dan recently decided he wants to play piano. He used to take piano lessons as a child, but he wants to refresh his memory and learn more in-depth skills. Dan has researched online for piano lessons, but many require in-person sessions or come with subscriptions for lengthy courses. He does not have enough time to start an online piano course from scratch, nor does he have time for weekly in-person lessons. He wants a music learning method that can start at his current level of experience. Futher, he needs a platform that provides an overview of lessons so he can efficiently choose what to learn at his own time and pace. 

#### Design Feature: Placement Quiz
> *The Placement Quiz feature will allow users to start lessons according to their level of expertise. Quiz questions will ask users what they are trying to learn and specific questions about their past experience. After completion of the quiz, users will be provided with a suggestion of what chapter and lesson they should start on in the application. Note: This quiz will be optional for users. If users choose to exit out of the quiz, they can always complete it later.*

#### Use Cases
Dan finds the login page to the music learning application, and creates a new account. Upon signing in, the "Placement Quiz" pops up on screen, informing him he can find out where to begin lessons according to their skill level. Dan decicides to proceed with the quiz and clicks the start button. The quiz questions start by asking what Dan wants to learn. Dan selects piano. Then Dan completes a series of questions about his past experience. With his completion of the quiz, Dan is informed that he should start at Lesson 3 since he's had some prior experience with piano basics. He selects the "Take me there!" icon, and the application brings him to the beginning of Lesson 3, where Dan begins his lessons. In the case that Dan wants to refresh his memory on basic concepts, Lesson 1-2 (and all lessons) are accessible to him at any time through the menu bar.

### Jacob's Scenario

#### Context
As a solo guitarist, Jacob loves to jam out on his guitar in between grad school projects. Jacob practices about 5-8 hours weekly in his music room, and on weekends he enjoys performing at local bars and coffee shops. He performs by himself, but wants to start performing with other people. Although he has only learned to play guitar solo, Jacob now seeks to learn how to play with instrumental accompanyment. Jacob has looked for other local musicians in Los Angeles through social media platforms including Instagram and Facebook. However, he finds it difficult to connect with musicians that are at his skill level, are nearby, and have time to practice.

#### Design Feature: Social Connection
> *The Social Connection feature will help connect musicians nearby by allowing users to create a profile and make postings for seeking accompanyment. This feature will include group chats that can be categorized by area to ensure that musicians find partners in close proximity. The feature will also include a map visualization that allows users to view local postings, and gage how close or far other users post.*

#### Use Cases
Jacob creates a profile on the music application. Through the application, Jacob navigates to the menu where he finds a section called "Practice with Others". In this section, Jacob finds joinable group chat icons for different areas around Los Angeles County. These group chats include musicians of all different instrument experience. As Jacob scrolls down from the joinable group chats, he finds a map that features posts made recently near him. He searches for postings near his location in LA. Three people have posted in the last month about needing a guitarist to practice playing with. Jacob clicks on their profiles and sends them a private message expressing his interest in meeting up.
