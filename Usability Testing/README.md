# Music Learning Through Online Platforms
## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Introduction
[Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) is a website that invites users to learn about digital music creation through interactive lessons and activities. The site is organized into chapters with numerous sub-lessons. Chapter topics include beats, notes and scales, chords, basslines, melodies, song structure, and more advanced topics. The design of this website aims to simplify the learning process of digital music making. Unlike other popular music creation platforms, Learning Music presents a simplistic design and provides help and information about the various components of digital music. While the design is simple, there are a few features on this site that should be changed in order to improve overall usability. A heuristic evaluation has been previously conducted on this site to identify potential usability issues with higher or lower severity ratings. With the heuristic evaluation complete, I will now conduct a pilot usability test to further investigate the usability issues of the Learning Music website. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing
Usability Testing (UT) evaluates a product by testing respresentative users through observation and user feedback. UT helps identify potential issues in a product, thus directing improvements that will result in a more effective, efficient, and satisfactory product for users. In terms of usability, effectiveness refers to how accurate and complete users are able to achieve specified tasks. Efficiency refers to how fast and fluently users are able to execute a specified task. And satisfaction refers to the positive attitudes and comfortability users experience after using a product that may encourage users to use the product again. The goal of UT is to evaluate where a product might be lacking or successful in these (and many more) areas. In this current part of my project, I will utilize UT to investigate the usability of the Learning Music website. Although I have already completed a heuristic evaluation, UT will help uncover more global usability problems and allow for a deeper evaluation by observing a representative user of the site.

## Methodology
This pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet office room located in my apartment. I will be using a Macbook Air laptop with a built-in camera to present the survey, capture participant actions, and record participant's comments/facial expressions. The study will be recorded via Zoom.

I, the moderator, and the user will sit adjacent to one another throughout the study. The user will recieve an introduction to the study purpose, and preliminary information about the test. The user will read and complete an informed consent form before completing the survey. I will guide the user throughout the study and encourage them to recite their thought process and comments while completing the survey. After completing specified tasks, the user will provide feedback about their experience. The survey will conclude with a demographic section with questions about the user; answers in this section will be kept confidential.

### Survey Material: Overview
- Introduction
- Informed Consent Form
- Background Questions
- Pre-Test Questionnaire
- Tasks (4)
- Post-Test Questionnaire
- SUS Questionnaire
- Production Satisfaction Card
- Demographic Questions

### Task Material: Purpose and Overview

| Task | Heuristic Tested | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Find and Practice major triad chords | Recognition Rather than Recall, Match between System and Real World | User must navigate through the menu bar to a specified lesson, complete the lesson interaction, and identify where to check for solution. |
| 2. Listen to and edit drum beats | Consistency and Standards, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | User must remember where to navigate to a different lesson, play the demonstration, and complete the lesson interaction. |
| 3. Create a second bar of drum beats and save work | User Control and Freedom, Error Prevention, Match between System and Real World | User must navigate to a new lesson, identify specified buttons and selections, and indentify how to save their work. |
| 4. Find further information about synthesizers and contact form | Help and Documentation | User must find further information about a specified topic. They must also find where to contact the company for any questions or comments. |

## Results and Observations
The pilot usability test yielded several interesting results. The user effectively completed all tasks, except for the step where they had to save their work. Some tasks took longer than others because some features were slightly confusing to the user. Below is an overview of each feature the user used in the tasks, and observations for how each task was executed.

| Website Feature | Observations |
|---|---|
| Menu Bar | The user was able to navigate to different lessons effectively through the menu bar. However, the user seemed slightly confused about which icon to click when accessing the menu. The user did not recognize that the menu icon represented the menu until much later in the test. This shows a minor issue in the website's consistency and standards: the menu icon and bar is designed differently than that of other websites. |
| Play Demonstrations | When the user was instructed to "listen" to demonstrations, they effectively and smoothly identified the play buttons. These features were easily recognizeable and familiar to the user. |
| Check for Correct Solution | User efficiently identified the "Check Solution" button. However, the correct solution automatically showed when user completed the interaction correctly. This might be a potential issue with user freedom if user wants to make an attempt before showing the right answer. |
| Tempo Toggle Feature | The user effectively and efficiently navigated to the toggle feature when instructed to change the tempo. A potential issue here was that the help pop-up blocked the "Tempo" label. If user does not close out of the pop-up, the purpose of this toggle would be unclear to the user. |
| Beat and Sound Selection | Beat and sound buttons were familiar to the user. However, when selecting multiple consecutive beats, the user was not aware they could click and drag across the buttons to make multiple selections. |
| Bar Selection | It took a relatively longer time for the user to identify where each bar was located. The user did not know they could click and select the second bar option. The user executed the task successfully, but they were unsure about their actions because it was difficult to differentiate the first and second bar. |
| Save Work | User was unable to save their work. They identified an "Export to Live" button, but thought that they would have to subscribe to Ableton in order to use this feature. |
| Help and Documentation | User quickly and effectively navigated to further information and help. They easily found where to contact the company via email through the menu bar. An important observation to note is that the user initially looked for a "Contact Us" option around the page before navigating through the menu. |

## Reflection
Conducting the pilot usability test was more difficult than I had expected. Initially, I conducted this study with a different user. This first test I ran went poorly, because the user made me laugh very often and it was difficult to keep the user on track. I thus conducted a second test with a different user to avoid recall and participant bias. The second test (the test used for my current submission) went much more smoothly because I was able to direct the new user more effectively and neutrally. I noticed that this user had more experience with digital tools than the average population. If I were to conduct a UT study again, I would ensure that all participants had different levels of experience with tech and digital products. 

Although experienced, the user still ran into some issues with the website (documented in "Results and Observations" section above). I was surprised to learn that the different menu-icon design would result in the user ignoring the icon and clicking elsewhere to access the menu. The user did not utilize this menu icon until he explored the site more after the tasks. This helped me further understand the importance of consistency and standards. In the post-task feedback questions, the user seemed satisfied with the website as a whole. He noted that he really enjoyed how simple the product was compared to other music learning platforms. Overall, I feel that this pilot test ran smoothly. In future studies I will remember to remain neutral as a moderator and select participants of different exerience levels.
