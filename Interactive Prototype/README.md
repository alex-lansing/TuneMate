# High-Fidelity Prototype

## Assignment 7: UX Interactive Prototype
Alexandra Lansing | DH110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
This portion of my project is creating a working prototype of my music-learning app design. The purpose of high-fidelity prototyping is to demonstrate the graphic design and interactivity of an application. I used Figma to create my prototype while following my prior-created wireframes and wireflow. 

The following prototype illustrates 7 main tasks:
1. Complete the music experience placement quiz to start on a suggested lesson
2. View personal progress and completed lessons
3. View user profile to see posts and achievements
4. Access TuneMate Connect, join a group chat
5. Comment on other user posts in TuneMate Connect
6. View other user profiles
7. Direct message other users

## Cognitive Walkthrough
After completing the first draft of my prototype, I recieved feedback from other UX students in the DH110 course. Feedback about my prototype was recorded through Google Forms, and can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1De325Z9QuXnAkKbLBi8ejk8dKOU9v8-tDfxbD_bGsUg/edit?usp=sharing).

### Findings Summary
| Feature | Feedback | Reflection |
|---|---|---|
| Color Scheme | "I like the blue theme, it makes it feel academic but still fun." | This feedback was encouraging because the blue color scheme I chose was meant to make the app look academic and fun. |
| Lesson Activity | "A 'next' button after the lesson would be helpful." | This is an important feature to consider when more lesson content is developed. Users should have a next button (towards the bottom right of the page) to move through lesson content.  |
| Lesson Menu | "I'm used to all lessons being on one page." | This feedback is good to note. However, the layout of the application would be much more complicated/confusing if users were required to scroll to access all lesson topics. Perhaps the menu bar could be organized in a way that is more clear to users. |
| Overall Design | "Looks legit and professional." | This was an encouraging comment because I hoped for the design to present a professional aesthetic. |

My peers gave valuable feedback on the TuneMate prototype. The comment that stood out most was that a "next" button should be added to lesson activity pages. I definitely plan to add this feature as I continue to develop my prototype. If I were to conduct a cognitive walkthrough again, I would survey more individuals, and ask more in-depth questions. This in-class cognitive walkthrough did not provide as much insight as I would have hoped due to limited time and participants. Thus I decided to conduct a Usability Test for deeper insight.

## Usability Testing

I conducted a Usability Test using the Figma interactive prototype and Google Forms. This study was conducted in a quiet room of the participant's apartment located in Los Angeles, CA. The session was recorded via Zoom on an iMac Pro. The video recording can be viewed at the link below.

### Survey Material
- Introduction
- Informed Consent Form

### User Tasks
1. Sign up, Complete placement quiz, Begin a lesson
2. Navigate to TuneMate Connect, Join a group, Create a post
3. Navigate to another user profile, Check their achievements, Access direct messages, Check message inbox
4. Navigate to settings, Sign out

### Observations
| Feature | Observations | Improvement Ideas |
|---|---|---|
| Quiz Choices | User noted the desire to have an "All of the Above" choice for the learning-interest question. | Make these selections radio buttons so users can select multiple interest options. |
| TuneMate Connect | User tried to find TuneMate Connect under the menu tab but could only access through the bottom-bar icon. | Create access to TuneMate Connect in the menu. |
| Settings | User tried finding settings under the menu tab but could only access through the profile page. | Create access to settings in the menu. |
| Chat Icon | User was confused if the chat icons had the same functionality, because they had different designs on different pages. | Make chat icon design consistent on each page of the application. |
| Decorative Details | User noted that the top background decorations were slightly unappealing because they were different across the app pages. | Reduce the variations of background designs. |

Overall, the Usability Test provided valuable feedback for my prototype design. It was encouraging to see that the user was able to interact with the prototype smoothly, but many changes are still needed for a satisfactory design. The most urgent changes to be made are noted above. I plan to integrate these improvement ideas as I continue to refine the TuneMate prototype.
