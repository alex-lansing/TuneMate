# Heuristic Evaluation
### Alexandra Lansing

As our world becomes increasingly influenced by media and tech, much education has shifted online. The internet provides numerous resources for learning skills that would otherwise be taught in school or other in-person locations. As a pianist, I grew up learning music theory from a teacher at home. Our music lessons involved tangible, off-line materials including paperback theory books and piano keys. But with the growing popularity of educational websites, people can learn music theory with the click of a mouse. Further, music has become an art made not only through instruments, but digital tools. In this project, I plan to analyze the music theory learning site, [LightNote](https://www.lightnote.co/), and the digital music making site, [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html), to see how modern websites educate users about music. I will explore the different aspects of each site that contribute to their overall user experience. I hope to learn what adds to the usability and educative qualities of both sites, and further, identify improvements that should be made to create a better user experience. These findings will help direct my own project of a music learning platform constructued via the user experience process. I will incorporate UX properties that I find valuable and effective in my research, and avoid usability errors identified in my analyses. In this first assignment, I will analyze the Usability Heuristics of each website's design, and provide the Severity Ratings of design issues with explanations and potential solutions.

### [10 Usability Heuristics](https://medium.muz.li/10-tips-on-how-to-conduct-a-perfect-heuristic-evaluation-ae5f8f4b3257) Overview
Heuristic Evaluation is a method that helps creators find usability problems in the design of a product. The 10 Usability Heuristics provide criteria for user-friendly experiences, thus helping designers identify potential problems in a design and directing the overall design process.

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Inform users what is going on throughout the design. Feedback should be given after user's actions and status of actions should be clearly visible.|
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Concepts, language, and visualizations should be familiar and logical to the user. |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to execute actions freely, even if errorful. Provide options to undo and redo tasks. |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Design should be consistent with other existing designs, and consistent throughout the entire product. |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Prevent possibility of errors throughout the design and provide users with ways to fix possible errors. |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Provide suggestions and visible options to minimize user's memory load. |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Create various ways for users to execute a task, providing broad accessibility for different users. |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Make user tasks as simple as possible by avoiding complicated designs and only including relevant features. |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | When a problem arises, clearly indicate the issue to users and provide suggestions for how to fix the problem. |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Provide further instructions that are accessible and understandable for users who need more help. |


### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-/) Overview
Severity Ratings are used to identify the most vital problems of a design. These ratings help evaluate products in terms of their usability and design. Higher ratings yield higher importance of an issue. The severity of a usability problem is measured with respect to the frequency in which the problem occurs, the impact of the problem, and the persistence of the problem.

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No usability problem at all |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
| 4 | Usability Catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released |

In this assignment, I will rate usability problems with severity ratings between 1-3 : Cosmetic Problem, Minor Usability Problem, or Major Usability Problem.

## Website 1: [LightNote](https://www.lightnote.co/)
### About
*LightNote provides interactive music theory lessons online through step-by-step chapters on seven fundamental topics. These topics include Sound Waves, Harmony, Pentatonic Scales, Chromatic Scales, Chords, Keys, and Diatonic Chords. Throughout each lesson, users are provided with visualizations of music concepts, buttons for interactivity, and text descriptions of each topic. For my initial overall evaluation, I can see that the page is easy to navigate and the purpose of each button is clear to users. However, in some of the topics, the functionality of each button begins to be slightly confusing. Further, the site lacks further help options and information for handling technical difficulties. This site is accessible at https://www.lightnote.co/ .*

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status | Most interactive tasks provided in each of the 7 lessons have an indication of what is occurring during the interaction. In the Harmony lesson, the sound wave interaction displays which wave form is currently displayed after selection. In the Diatonic Chords lesson, the chord-fitting questions clearly indicate what options have been selected, which selected answers were correct/incorrect, and the key's corresponding numbers change position as the user hovers above each selection. Throughout each task, users are mostly provided with visible feeback for their actions with visible responses that are understandable and logical. A possible issue that arises with visibility of system status is when sound is played by the user. When user clicks the "Play" buttons, there isn't indication of sound playing in every task. |**Severity Rating: 2** Minor changes should be made to indicate when sounds are being played by the user. No severe immediate changes need to be made to the site for status visibility. | Create a visual indication to users of when sounds are playing on the site. For example, when the user clicks the "Play" buttons, buttons should fade out while sound is playing to indicate status of the noise playing. |
| Match Between System and Real World | Icons and design is based off of general knowledge. "Play" buttons are designed appropriately with well-known "play" icons. Piano key visualizations are numbered logically with recognizable visualizations of the instrument and familiar labeling design. Toggles to increase or decrease wave height resemble toggles typically shown in digital designs that user can move up or down linearly. | **Severity Rating: 1** Design of interactions and tasks are recognizable and familiar to the user. | Minimal improvements needed in this area. The interactive tasks are labeled logically with recognizable icons and interactive components that users have seen in past experiences with other interactive sites, applications, or visualizations. |
| User Control and Freedom | User should have multiple options in interaction and be able to undo and redo actions. The interactions of this site allow users to play piano keys and lesson tasks repetitively. However, users are unable to undo their actions without refreshing the page. In the Diatonic Chords section, users must select chords that fit together, but selections are permanent. Users are unable to deselect their options or reset the question choices.| **Severity Rating: 3** There is limited flexibility and options for actions taken by user. No options to undo/reset/clear selections on tasks. | Add an undo or clear button where users are allowed to deselect their options. |
| Consistency and Standards | Design is consistent with other existing application designs, where sound play buttons are indicated with recognizeable play icons and interactive piano tasks are made up of familiar keyboard visualizations labeled logically in numerical order. Unclickable options are faded (lower opacity), similar to other existing applications. The numbered keys are consistent throughout the site, each key corresponding to the same number and color across all tasks. A potential issue here is that the Chord numbering looks like clickable buttons. | **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic change needed for number icons under the chords. Users viewing these icons might mistake them for buttons since their design is consistent with other buttons on the page. | Change the numeric chord labels to numbers of different colors, rather than numbers highlighted by a dark circle. Avoiding the circle shape will limit confusion between button and unclickable icon. |
| Error Prevention | User is able to play other notes while demonstrations are running, thus disrupting the tasks. No options provided to restart the demonstration -- user can only restart demonstration after entire demonstration finishes. | **Severity Rating: 3** Users are easily able to disrupt the tasks and there is no option to restart musical demonstrations. | Prevent possibility of disrupting the music demonstrations by disabling the piano key buttons while demonstration is playing. Allow user to restart demonstration when desired by providing a "restart" button. |
| Recognition Rather than Recall | Lesson tasks provide clear options for user selection, minimizing user's memory load. Sound wave tasks offer 3 buttons that display corresponding visualizations upon clicking. The keyboard visualizations are labeled 1-12 throughout every lesson, reminding users of the number-key pairs in each task. Design could improve by including keyboard visualization in tasks that only have numbers, to remind the user what keys the numbers represent. | **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic change could be made in the design of the Scale lesson, where users are shown only numbers. The number-only display causes users to recall the piano keys that correspond with the numbers. | Provide an additional visualization of the piano keys and their number pairs, or a written explanation of the numbers' correspondence with piano keys. |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Users are able to execute tasks in various ways. For instance, users are able to play all different types of chords, or click on piano keys individually. However, there are no options for shortcuts. Users are unable to toggle settings if they want to create their own chords. Chord playing is pre-set. | **Severity Rating: 2** Users have limited ability to customize the chords played. There are only pre-set chord options. No settings provided where users can toggle the ability to play their own chords or create shortcuts. | Make settings available where users are able to combine notes to form their own chords, even when chords do not sound correct. This would improve the flexibility of the tasks and expand accessibility for all users. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Design of the website is simple, and only relevant features are displayed. User options -- buttons and piano keys -- are clear and direct. Concise explanations are provided in each lesson, and brief descriptions of tasks are displayed only when necessary. | **Severity Rating: 1** Design includes only the necessary features that direct each lesson. Explanations, buttons, toggles, and user options each have a clear purpose. | Little improvement needed in this area. Site displays a simple, minimalistic design with only relevant features and options displayed. |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | There is no help or further information provided when an issue arises. If users accidently select an option, or choose an incorrect answer in the Chords lesson, there is no help provided for restarting the lesson. User can only refresh the page to clear their selection choices. | **Severity Rating: 3** If user makes an error there is no indication for how to fix the problem. An incorrect or undesired selection is permanent on the site unless the user refreshes the page entirely. | Provide an undo button and a pop-up help explanation when users make undesired selections in the lesson tasks. |
| Help and Documentation | There is no further instructions that are accessible and understandable for users who need more help. No additional information, FAQ section, or help chat box seen throughout the website. |  **Severity Rating: 3** Users are not provided with extra help or information if needed throughout the lesson tasks. | Provide an Info button for tasks that are more complicated for users to understand. Upon clicking on the info button, explain to users what their task is and how to troubleshoot issues that may arise when they select undesired buttons. Further, the website could provide a help chat box or FAQ section that offers users extra help with the tasks if needed. |

## Website 2: [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html)
### About
*Learning Music is an online platform that teaches users how to create digital music. This site provies lessons on each step of the digital music making process: Beats, Sounds, Tempo, Genre, Backbeats, Bars, and creating personalized cover songs. Each lesson presents interactive features that invite users to explore personalized combinations of beats and sounds. In my initial overall evaluation, I can see that the site is slightly more difficult to navigate. The function of each button and selection are not as clear to the user. However, the site provides pop-up explanations that help the user navigate more easily through the lesson tasks. Further, the user has great freedom in creating their own personalized beat and sound patters. There are also options to reset selections in each lesson, and a "reset all lessons" option if users want to restart their music making process. This site is accessible at https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html .*

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status | Application indicates to users what lesson they are on at the top left of the screen. This allows users to keep track of their progress through the site. Further, in the interactive beat and sound making tasks, the status of each feature is shown by highlighted segments. When beats are selected, they remain highlighted to demonstrate to users which beats and instruments are active in the song. |**Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic changes could be made to indicate better the status of user's progress through the lessons. | Create a visual indication of user's progress through the lessons at the bottom of each lesson page. For example, create a horizontal bar that fills as user completes more tasks. |
| Match Between System and Real World | Icons of features are based off of general knowledge. "Play" buttons use the standard play icon that users can recognize from past experiences. Toggle options for adjusting tempo are familiar to users and function of these toggles is direct and clear. However, in the bars lesson, the clickable options for different bars is not as familiar with users. The option to select these bars is not clear. | **Severity Rating: 2** Minor adjustments needed to indicate that users are able to select different bar options. These selections are not as familiar to users because they do not look like familiar clickable buttons/options. Icons used are clear and recognizable and do not need to be altered. | Design the bar selections to look like clickable features that users are familiar with. For example, create more contrast between the bar selections and the background div, so the selections look more like clickable buttons. |
| User Control and Freedom | Users are presented multiple options for beats and sounds in the interactive tasks. They are able to undo and clear their selections, and create unique combinations of music features. However, there is no redo option if users clear their selections. | **Severity Rating: 2** Users are unable to redo their selections if they clear their choices. This limits user control and freedom because they are unable to experiment multiple combinations of music features without erasing past work. | Provide an option for users to redo if they clear their work. Further, provide users the option to save their work. One possible suggestion for this is creating a user login, where different profiles can store saved projects. |
| Consistency and Standards | Design is mostly consistent with other preexisting applications. Buttons indicate selection when they are highlighted, help pop-ups are familiar to the user, and standard arrows direct the user to the next lesson. However, the ability to drag and select multiple buttons at once is unclear. These selections are only displayed by plain rectangular buttons; there is no indication that you can select multiple at a time by dragging. | **Severity Rating: 1** Icons are consistent with existing applications and they remain the same throughout the design of the website. Cosmetic changes needed for indicating to the user that they can drag and select multiple buttons at a time when selecting beats and sounds. | Change the design of the beat and sound buttons from plain rectangles to rectangles with a drag indication towards the right. This could be in the form of a small grey bar. This would indicate (in a consistent and familiar way) that users can click and drag across the screen if they want to select multiple buttons at a time. |
| Error Prevention | User is provided with a "Fill in solution" option that will clear incorrect selections and complete tasks with the correct solution. "Reset" options are available at the top of every task, which will clear all selections and revert back to the original set-up if users want to restart. | **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic improvements could be made to help direct users from creating errorful selections. For example, the site could provide more initial visualizations of different sound and beat combinations. However, help pop-ups direct users in tasks throughout the site, and show-solution buttons are offered for the complicated tasks. | Error prevention is relatively strong in this site due to the show-solution options for tasks, reset options, and help pop-ups. The design could reduce users' errorful music combinations by providing more visual examples of beat and sound combinations. Users could be able to select these combinations and use them on their own template, so they can experiment with the examples given. |
| Recognition Rather than Recall | Users are provided with clear selections labeled appropriately. Menu items are shown in a drop down to the left of the screen, allowing the user to easily access their current lesson and other lessons when needed. | **Severity Rating: 1** Elements, actions, and options are clearly visible to the user. The user is able to keep track of what lesson they are on, what task they are completing, and what selections they have made. Cosmetic edits could be made to help the user undertand better what part of the lesson they are on since there are several lessons with numerous chapters. | Next to the lesson number indicated at the top left of the page, provide the title of the main lesson that users are currently on. This would allow useres to track their progress more smoothly instead of having to click on the menu every time to see where they are at. |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Users are able to execute tasks with keyboard shortcuts. As seen in the Beats lesson, users have the option to switch "Keyboard ON" or "Keyboard OFF", which allows users to select options with the number keys on their keyboard. However, this keyboard shortcut is only available in a limited set of tasks. This shortcut is not available for the main tasks of selecting beats and sounds.| **Severity Rating: 2** Users have limited ability to create keyboard shortcuts when selecting beats and sounds. | Include the keyboard shortcut for beat and sound selection tasks. The number keys could correspond to the selections, making the application more accessible for multiple users. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Design of the website is somewhat simple, but many clickable options can be confusing for the user. The menu can be accessed by both the menu icon and "Chapters" icon, which is redundant in the design. All buttons for music features are designed with the same shape and color, which is simple, but distinguising the features from one another might be executed better with different colors. | **Severity Rating: 2** Design includes some redundant features that could be fixed with minor adjustments. Music feature selections are indistinguishable without the text, and are not as aethetic as could be possible. | Menu icon could be referenced only once at the top of the page. This would limit redundancy and allow users to more easily navigate to different lessons and chapters. The buttons could be colored differently in order to demonstrate the difference between each music feature being selected. |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | Users are provided with help pop-ups throughout each lesson that instruct users how to use the task features and fix issues if errorful selections are made. | **Severity Rating: 1** If user makes an error there is indication for how to fix the problem. Difficulties are predicted beforehand and help pop-ups help users avoid these issues. | Little improvement needed in this area. Possible cosmetic changes could be made to make the help pop-ups more visible for users. Users should also be able to re-view the help suggestions once they disappear. |
| Help and Documentation | Further instructions are provided in the "Where to go from here" option. Users are also able to view more information in the "Go to Ableton.com" option. Help pop-ups direct users consistently throughout all lessons. |  **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic changes could be made where users are able to view help for each lesson when desired (even after the pop-up disappears). Further instructions and information are sufficiently visible and accessible. | Provide an Info button that displays help information for each task, so users can access suggestions at any point in their work. Make the "Go to Ableton.com" option more visible in the Menu bar. An FAQ section could also be provided for further information for users. |
