## Project Description
This project aims to improve the music learning process through a simple application. Based on my prior Usability Testing, Qualitatative User Research, and User Scenarios, I have made note of features that users need and desire in a digital music-learning platform. During the Usability Testing, I investigated the features of a pre-existing application called [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) by Abelton.com. In this study, I found that my subject was satisfied by the simplicity of the learning activities. The buttons were clearly indicated and there were clear directions and further help provided for each activity. The main issue found in this study was that the menu bar was difficult to find at first, because the menu icon/placement was not familiar to the user. In my Qualitative Research study, I observed how a subject utilizes their own digital tools to assist in music learning. Through my observations, I found that the user desires an application that provides a broad set of learning material that is tailored to his prior experience. The main issue that this subject noted was that he has difficulty finding other musicians nearby to practice with.

From these research studies, I decided to focus on improving the main issues found in current music-learning applications. The first improvement would be to create an application that is easily navigable and tailored to the user's experience level. This would involve creating a simple menu bar with an overview of clear lesson plans, and a placement quiz that suggests which lesson users should start with based on their experience level. The second improvement would be to create an application that connects music-learning users with others nearby via a social connection platform. This would involve a social chat feature where users are able to find others in the area by joining local group chats.

These improvements inspired two User Scenarios. The first scenario involved a busy hobbyist, who had some prior music experience, and wanted to learn more about music. Due to their lack of time, the hobbyist utilized a "Placement Quiz" feature to help them efficiently begin lessons based on their prior experience. The hobbyist was also able to navigate efficiently to other lessons through the Menu when they wanted to skip around lesson topics. The second scenario involved a social guitarist, who wanted to connect with other musicians nearby to practice playing with others. This guitarist utilized the "Social Connection" feature in the application to find local musicians that wanted to practice together. The guitarist searched through a local group chat, and reached out to another musician via direct message / commenting. The users were able to communicate through the application and arrange for a time to practice together.

With research and user scenarios complete, this current project now focuses on developing a low-fidelity prototype that integrates each feature noted to improve the music-learning application. The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to test the functionality and flow of application features utilized in envisioned tasks. The tasks supported by this prototype are as follows:

### Tasks
1. Complete the Placement Quiz to find out which Lesson to start on
2. Navigate to different Lessons
3. Check lesson progress
4. Find other musicians through a Group Chat
5. Create a Post in the Group Chat
6. Comment on another user's post
7. Direct Message another user

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
The following material demonstrates the Wireframes, Wireflow, and Wireflow Testing of a low-fidelity prototype for my music-learning application idea. Further, two usage scenarios are provided with wireframes and flow of the two tasks described in my user scenarios.

## Wireframes

## Wireflow

## Usage Scenario 1
#### The user has some prior experience in piano, and wants to learn music efficiently. They take the placement quiz to see where to begin in the lesson plan. This allows the user to quickly start learning instead of starting from the basics. In case the user wants to learn more basic topics, they can easily navigate through the menu to view all other lesson topics. The user is satisfied by the easy-to-navigate layout and their ability to learn/skip through topics efficiently.

## Usage Scenario 2
#### The user is an experienced guitarist, and wants to practice playing with others. They utilize the social feature in the application to find musicians that are nearby. The social feature provides group chats of different areas so the user can find musicians in their specific area. The user navigates to their area's group chat and comments on a nearby musician's post, and also messages them directly to initiate a private conversation. The user is able to arrange a time and place to meet with the other musician. They are satisfied that they can now start practicing music with other people.

## Wireflow Testing

#### Interaction 1 Task : *Create Account, Complete Quiz, Complete One Lesson*
#### Interaction 2 Task : *Log In, View User Progress, View User Profile*

#### Interaction 3 Task : *Log In, Re-Take Placement Quiz*
#### Interaction 4 Task : *Navigate to TuneMate Connect, Join a Group Chat, Comment on a Post, Direct Message another User*

## Reflection
Low-fidelity prototyping is much more challenging than I expected. There are so many components of an application that I as a user take for granted. In order to gain inspiration for my prototype, I did a lot of initial research on layouts of learning applications and social media apps. Interestingly, I came across an app called [Musicate](https://musicate.app/), which included a very short "Placement Quiz" that I used for inspiration for my project. Musicate's quiz was much shorter than I would've liked, so I made sure to include more details in my project's quiz. Further, the Musicate app was slightly disorganized, so I chose a different layout for my design. This app was a great reference, but I definitely derived most inspiration from my User Research and Contextual Inquiry.

To reflect on my Wireflow Testing, it was interesting to observe how a person interacts with something I designed myself. I aimed to make as detailed of Wireframes as possible to avoid any possible confusion with my design's functionality. However, the user still found some holes in my design. Below is an overview of what issues were found and what improvements should be made:

| App Feature | User Commentary | Improvement Ideas |
|---|---|---|
| Quiz: Instrument Question | What happens if I select "Other" if I want to learn violin? | Include a pop-up that allows users to type in what Instrument they wish to learn, and take that into account for user profile. |
| Quiz: Exit "X" | The "X" doesn't seem necessary since there are already buttons to go to the specified Lesson or back to Lesson 1. | Remove an exit option from the quiz, thus only providing the users with two lesson start options. |
| Profile Page | I don't know how to edit my profile. | Include an "Edit Profile" button on the Profile page. |
| User Progress | What happens when I select a Lesson under "Completed Lessons"? | Need a wireframe that shows the design of lessons once they are completed. Perhaps create a "Lesson Complete" page that also displays a "Start Over" option for the user if they wish to do the lesson again. |

From my observations, I feel that the most urgent improvement to make is with the quiz, since there is no page designed for when the user selects "Other" instrument or "Other" point of interest. I plan to implement each of these improvements in the next step of my design process. Overall, The Wireflow Testing provided great insights for my Low-Fidelity prototype, and gave me a new perspective on the user's interaction with my layout.
